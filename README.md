# personal scripts

These are some scripts I made for my laptop. The idea is just to automate some 
tasks I usually do. Some of them I map to a keyboard shortcut, others are just an 
alias to some command or couple of commands. Maybe I can give a full description 
of each one someday, but right now I just want to mantain this as a sort of 
backup. Feel free to ask me about anything or to make suggestions.
